Changelog: [Commit History on Main](https://github.com/IvanButBetter/MazeRunner/commits/main/Game.html)

## Why is this branch seperated? <br> <br>

This branch is seperated because it needs to be titled index.html instead of calling it game.html, and also it is nice to keep it in seperate branches. <br>

## Disclaimer <br>
The web version of the game is can be somewhat laggy. If it is running too poorly, please download the code from [main](https://github.com/IvanButBetter/MazeRunner). You only need to download game.html and run it in your browser of choice.
