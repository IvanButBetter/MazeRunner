## Why is this branch seperated? <br> <br>

This branch is seperated because it needs to be titled index.html instead of calling it whatever I want, and also it is nice to keep it in seperate branches. <br>

## Disclaimer <br>
The web version of the game is somewhat laggy, particularly for the player character image. If it is running too poorly, please download the code from [main](https://github.com/IvanButBetter/MazeRunner) as well as the "characterLarge.png". Make sure that both files are in the same folder to avoid issues. Furthermore, some functions on the web version do not work as well on the online version such as offline mode.
