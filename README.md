# MazeRunner Web Branch
You can access the game on [Github Pages](https://ivanbutbetter.github.io/MazeRunner/). You can access the main branch [here](https://github.com/IvanButBetter/MazeRunner) <br>

## Why is this branch seperated? <br> <br>

This branch is seperated because it needs to be titled index.html instead of calling it whatever I want, and also it is nice to keep it in seperate branches.
