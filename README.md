# MazeRunner Web Branch
You can access the game on [Github Pages](https://ivanbutbetter.github.io/MazeRunner/). You can access the main branch [here](https://github.com/IvanButBetter/MazeRunner) <br>

## Why is this branch seperated? <br> <br>

This branch is seperated because it needs to be titled index.html instead of calling it whatever I want, and also it is nice to keep it in seperate branches. <br>

## Disclaimer <br>
The web version of the game is slightly laggy, particularly for the player character image. If it is running too poorly, please download the code from [main](https://github.com/IvanButBetter/MazeRunner) as well as the "characterLarge.png". Make sure that both files are in the same folder to avoid issues.
